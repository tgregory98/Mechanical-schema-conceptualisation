# A task list for personal use
- [x] Clean up the code into one file.
- [x] Build a class for building pairwise schema.
- [x] Run a sequence of depth increasing queries.
- [x] Add a filter option to the class.
- [x] Test out different search filters and optimise.
- [x] Write a class for building parent schema.
- [x] Write an inheritance class for PairwiseSchemaBuilder and ParentSchemaBuilder.
- [x] Clean up code.
- [x] Add options for node/ edge specific filters.
- [x] Move some node/ edge filter code to SchemaBuilder class.
- [x] Split into two files, creating a builders.py module.
- [x] Create cleaners.py and fetchers.py files.
- [x] Create a PopulateSchemaBuilder subclass that populates all immediate neighbours.
- [x] Build LeafSchemaCleaner class.
- [x] Create a modules folder.
- [x] Move Transactions operations to module scripts and move Cypher code for transactions to seperate module too.
- [x] Port cypher_query_set_gen to enrichers.py.
- [x] Build SingleComponentSchemaCleaner class using a community detection algorithm for connected components.
- [x] Build the DisjointParentSchemaCleaner class with the right idea this time.
- [x] Rebuild the DisjointParentSchemaCleaner class algorithm. The previous algorithm produced a Cypher query that was too long and doesn't run. There is a much simpler way of doing this.
- [x] Finish off building the DisjointParentSchemaCleaner class by configuring the depth variable in the query generation.
- [x] Make DisjointParentSchemaCleaner run on a set on nodes as opposed to just the two.
- [x] Refine the querying for DisjointParentSchemaCleaner to slightly more precise patterns.
- [x] Clean up demo images ready for first release.
- [x] Make node labels reflect depth.
- [x] Improve DisjointParentSchemaCleaner queries.
- [x] Update style.grass.
- [x] Create a wrapper to optimise the building processes.
- [x] Add ontology class building.
- [x] Fix vertex filters so that NodeSchemaCleaner may be removed.
- [x] Optimising the SPARQL query for finite depth parent building with FiniteParentSchemaBuilder.
- [x] Add duplication edge cleaning into the builder class run method.
- [ ] Work on entity resolution.
- [ ] Start building the front-end.
