# A task list for personal use
- [x] Clean up the code into one file.
- [x] Build a class for building pairwise schema.
- [x] Run a sequence of depth increasing queries.
- [x] Add a filter option to the class.
- [x] Test out different search filters and optimise.
- [x] Write a class for building parent schema.
- [x] Write an inheritance class for PairwiseSchemaBuilder and ParentSchemaBuilder.
- [x] Clean up code.
- [x] Add options for node/ edge specific filters.
- [x] Move some node/ edge filter code to SchemaBuilder class.
- [x] Split into two files, creating a builders.py module.
- [x] Create cleaners.py and fetchers.py files.
- [x] Create a PopulateSchemaBuilder subclass that populates all immediate neighbours.
- [x] Build LeafSchemaCleaner class.
- [x] Create a modules folder.
- [x] Move Transactions operations to module scripts and move Cypher code for transactions to seperate module too.
- [x] Port cypher_query_set_gen to enrichers.py.
- [x] Build SingleComponentSchemaCleaner class using a community detection algorithm for connected components.
- [x] Build the DisjointParentSchemaCleaner class with the right idea this time.
- [x] Rebuild the DisjointParentSchemaCleaner class algorithm. The previous algorithm produced a Cypher query that was too long and doesn't run. There is a much simpler way of doing this.
- [ ] Finish off building the DisjointParentSchemaCleaner class by configuring the depth variable in the query generation.
- [ ] Make all algorithms run on a set on nodes as opposed to just the two.
- [ ] Update the cypher_query_set_gen() strings.
